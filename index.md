# About us

This is the website for the `Ishaque-Lab`, supervised by Naveed Ishaque who is the group leader for [Computational Oncology](https://www.hidih.org/research/computational-oncology) at the [Center of Digital Health](https://www.bihealth.org/en/research/research-group/eils-lab-bih-digital-health-center)https://www.bihealth.org/en/research/research-group/eils-lab-bih-digital-health-center at the [Berlin Insitute of Health at Charite University Hospital](https://www.bihealth.org)https://www.bihealth.org.

Our group's interest lies in understanding the basis of biological heterogeneity using computational approaches applied to 'omics data in a disease context. We employ artificial intelligence (AI) and data science (DS) methods, not only to address the underlying causes of this heterogeneity but also the interactions between different molecular ‘omics layers. We have a strong specialization in the application area of oncology but are also very interested in immunology and neurodegenerative diseases.

By better understanding global and local patterns in biological data, we believe we can better differentiate the mechanisms behind biological and molecular processes from technical noise. As such, we rely on establishing close ties with experimental collaborators who can provide us with large-scale and high-dimensional datasets profiled using state-of-the-art and exotic 'omics profiling techniques. We aim to take advantage of recent technological advances that can resolve single-cell, spatial, temporal, and genetic heterogeneity.
