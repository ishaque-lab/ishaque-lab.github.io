## Our offices
-	Our offices are in Charite Campus Mitte (CCM), at [Kapelle Ufer 2, 10117, Berlin, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/place/52%C2%B031'25.3%22N+13%C2%B022'29.3%22E/@52.5237059,13.3741668,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d52.5237051!4d13.3748119?entry=ttu). We occupy the space on the third floor, left out of the elevator. The entrance door is at the side of the building that is facing the Futurium:

-	You will need a passport or ID card to enter. We are located in the federal building, so they take security a little more seriously. Please contact [Naveed Ishaque](naveed.ishaque@bih-charite.de) with your expected arrival time so that I can inform the security desk of your arrival times. Otherwise, you can tell the security desk that you are here to visit the BIH/Charite, and tell them you have an appointment with Naveed Ishaque, and provide my contact telephone number: +49 (0) 30 450 543096.
-	Office space is currently very restricted, so we are operating a hot-desking policy.
